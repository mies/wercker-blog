Today, we excited to announce our new logo and in this post we'd love to
share our process with you. Initially we were on the path of doing something with the 'w' character.
</h4>

Not only has this [been done](http://wikipedia.org) [before](http://wordpress.com), we were looking for a logo and shape that we could identify with ourselves.

Our mission with wercker is to create an **open delivery** platform  where developers come together to build amazing things. As such, we went with the *beehive* analogue that also represents a community of workers, or in our case developers.

We went through various iterations of the logo before we were happy with the final result. Everytime we made the logo simpler and flatter we found it stronger in appearance.

The shield around the *beehive* can be interpreted in different ways. First off, the shield represents power and reliability, two important aspects of our platform. The line forming the shield can be viewed as a tree branch or the path of a workerbee heading home.

The final result also leaded to a new font, called [Simplo](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo/), which is described as the 'Italic Futura'. It is a geometric sans-serif font and as such brings a strong presence to the wercker logotype.
