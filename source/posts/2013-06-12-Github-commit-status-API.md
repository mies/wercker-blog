<h4 class="subheader">
At wercker we make heavy use of GitHub and are big fans of what Tom, Chris, PJ, Scott and the rest of the GitHub team have built over the last years. When we started wercker, we wanted to integrate with GitHub to make the user experience for our continuous delivery smooth and seamless but also have a strong focus on collaboration. In this post we go into wercker's integration with the <a href="https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api">GitHub commit status api</a> for pull requests.
