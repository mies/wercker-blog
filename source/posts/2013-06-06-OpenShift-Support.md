<h4 class="subheader">
We're very excited to announce deployment support for OpenShift, RedHat's platform-as-a-service solution.
</h4>

OpenShift is RedHat's auto-scaling PaaS for web applications. Similar to wercker, OpenShift allows developers to focus on their code and not the management of your stack and infrastructure. You can sign up for OpenShift, for free, [here](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new).

Wercker is now also a developer partner on RedHat's OpenShift.

###Getting started with wercker and OpenShift

We've created a [sample application in Ruby on GitHub](https://github.com/wercker/wercker-capistrano) that you can fork to get started with OpenShift and wercker.

For a complete tutorial watch this screencast or view the [indepth guide](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/deployment/openshift.html) at our dev center.
