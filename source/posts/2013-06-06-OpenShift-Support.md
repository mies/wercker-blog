We're very excited to announce deployment support for OpenShift, RedHat's platform-as-a-service solution.

OpenShift is RedHat's auto-scaling PaaS for web applications. Similar to wercker, OpenShift allows developers to focus on their code and not the management of your stack and infrastructure. You can sign up for OpenShift, for free, [here](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/account/new).
