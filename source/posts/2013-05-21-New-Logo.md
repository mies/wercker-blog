Today, we excited to announce our new logo and in this post we'd love to share our process with you. Initially we were on the path of doing something with the **'w'** character.

Not only has this [been done](http://wikipedia.org) [before](http://wordpress.com), we were looking for a logo and shape that we could identify with ourselves.

Our mission with wercker is to create an **open delivery** platform  where developers come together to build amazing things. As such, we went with the *beehive* analogue that also represents a community of workers, or in our case developers.

We went through various iterations of the logo with the following result.

The final result also leaded to a new font, called Simplo, blalalas.
