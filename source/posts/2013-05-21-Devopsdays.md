Wercker will be sponsoring the [Devopsdays](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/) here in Amsterdam that will be organized on June 14th and 15th. The location is [Pakhuis de Zwijger](http://www.dezwijger.nl/), an old warehouse built in 1933.

The Devopsdays are two days packed with discussions on the intersection of development and operations. There will be both presentations and the opportunity for several open spaces sessions.

From the press release:

>DevOps is a collaboration between Development and Operations. On the one hand, operational continuity requirements as stability, reliability and performance get more focus in the development process. At the same time the skills of developers are used in operations to automate important processes like continuous deployment. Development gets more insight in the behaviour of and responsiblity for their applications that run in production. The DevOps way of working is an important development in order to meet the demands of today: online platforms constantly change and should thereby be continuously available. DevOps contributes to a "faster time to market", improves quality and increases organizational effectiveness.

Wercker will be presenting as well, specifically on the [opportunities](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/proposals/MichaHernandezvanLeuffen_MovingBeyondRedAndGreen/) we see in the continuous delivery space.
