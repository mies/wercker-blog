<h4 class="subheader">
At wercker we are firm believers in excellent documentation. As developers ourselves we want to be up and running with a new technolgy or system as fast as possible. As such, we have revamped our knowledge base and documentation site, the <a href="http://devcenter.wercker.com">wercker dev center</a>.

READMORE

We've made several improvements:

* more examples and step by step guides (for [python](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/python/flask.html), [node.js](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/nodejs/getting-started-express-and-mocha.html) and [ruby](http://devcenter.wercker.com/articles/languages/ruby.html))
* we've enabled commenting on every page, so we close the feedback loop with our users
* we now allow community edits by way of forking; contribute your own articles by forking the devcenter on [GitHub](https://github.com/wercker/wercker-devcenter/)

The new dev center is both a reference and a guide with a one page per topic structure allowing for easy navigation.

We have built the new dev center with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com), an excellent static site generator.

Please check out our [new documentation](http://devcenter.wercker.om) and let us know what you think!
