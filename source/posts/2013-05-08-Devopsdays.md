The Devopsdays Amsterdam are upon us! Previous conferences were in London, New York, Mountain View and even Sao Paulo, and now Amsterdam will bring you the event where you can learn more about dev and ops working together.

Wercker will be sponsoring the [Devopsdays](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/) here in Amsterdam that will be organized on June 14th and 15th. The location is [Pakhuis de Zwijger](http://www.dezwijger.nl/), an old warehouse built in 1933.

The Devopsdays are two days packed with discussions on the intersection of development and operations. There will be both presentations and the opportunity for several open spaces sessions.

Wercker will be presenting as well on the [opportunities](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/proposals/MichaHernandezvanLeuffen_MovingBeyondRedAndGreen/) we see in the continuous delivery space.

You can check out the excellent [program](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/program/) here and of course [register](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-amsterdam/registration/) as well.

Looking forward to talking to you at the Devopsdays in Amsterdam!
